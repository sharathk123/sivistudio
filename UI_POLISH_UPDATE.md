## 🎨 Overview

Following the comprehensive UI Audit, we have implemented a series of "Polish" updates focusing on micro-interactions, animation fluidity, and typographic consistency. These changes elevate the user experience from "Functional" to "Premium".

## ✨ Key Improvements

### 1. Micro-Animations
- **Cart Drawer**: Implemented smoother entrance/exit transitions and improved backdrop blur effects. The drawer now feels more grounded and responsive.
- **Checkout Success**: Enhanced the post-purchase experience with refined success state animations, ensuring a celebratory but elegant feedback loop.
- **Hover States**: Added subtle scaling and shadow transitions to interactive cards (Product Cards, Category Cards) to improve tactile feel.

### 2. Typography Standardization
- **Navigation Links**: Standardized capitalization to the "Editorial" style (lowercase articles, e.g., "The Story", "The Atelier") to match the brand voice.
- **Footer Typography**: Resolved rendering issues (pixelation) and standardized font weights/sizes for better legibility on all devices.
- **Button Styles**: Unified button heights, padding, and hover states across the application, specifically targeting the "Clear All Filters" and secondary action buttons.

### 3. Visual Consistency
- **No Data States**: polished "Empty State" views for Cart, Wishlist, and Search Results to be more visually appealing and helpful, rather than just empty voids.
